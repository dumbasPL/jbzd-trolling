# jbzd-trolling

A site named jbzd.com.pl used to have a misconfigured preverse proxy allowing you to spoof IP addresses using the `x-forwarded-for` header.  
I used this to "do a little trolling" and upvote some stupid posts to the top. No longer works, but I think that should be obvious by now.

Code is shit, releasing "AS IS"
